= Troubleshooting: Unbinding non bare metal nodes with late binding

If you are using the Nutanix or VMware vSphere platform, you must complete additional manual steps to destroy a late binding cluster and return the nodes back to the Discovery ISO. If you are using Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP), the nodes are automatically returned to the Discovery ISO.
