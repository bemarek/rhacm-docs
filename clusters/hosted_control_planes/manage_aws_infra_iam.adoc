[#hosted-control-planes-manage-aws-infra-iam]
= Managing AWS infrastructure and IAM permissions for hosted control planes (Technology Preview)

When you use hosted control planes for {ocp} on AWS, the infrastructure requirements vary based on your setup. 

* <<hosted-aws-infra-iam-prereqs,Prerequisites>>
* <<hosting-cluster-aws-infra-reqs,AWS infrastructure requirements>>
* <<iam-aws,Identity and Access Management permissions>>
* <<hosting-cluster-aws-infra-iam-separate,Creating AWS infrastructure and IAM resources separately>>

[#hosted-aws-infra-iam-prereqs]
== Prerequisites

You must configure hosted control planes before you can create hosted control plane clusters. See xref:../../clusters/hosted_control_planes/aws_intro.adoc#hosting-service-cluster-configure-aws[Configuring hosted control plane clusters on AWS (Technology Preview)] for more information.

[#hosting-cluster-aws-infra-reqs]
== AWS infrastructure requirements

When you use hosted control planes on AWS, the infrastructure requirements fit in the following categories:

* Prerequired and unmanaged infrastructure for the HyperShift Operator in an arbitrary AWS account
* Prerequired and unmanaged infrastructure in a hosted cluster AWS account
* Hosted control planes-managed infrastructure in a management AWS account
* Hosted control planes-managed infrastructure in a hosted cluster AWS account
* Kubernetes-managed infrastructure in a hosted cluster AWS account

_Prerequired_ means that hosted control planes requires AWS infrastructure to properly work. _Unmanaged_ means that no Operator or controller creates the infrastructure for you. The following sections contain details about the creation of the AWS resources.

[#infra-prerequired-unmanaged-for-ho]
=== Prerequired and unmanaged infrastructure for the HyperShift Operator in an arbitrary AWS account

An arbitrary AWS account depends on the provider of the hosted control planes service. 

In self-managed hosted control planes, the cluster service provider controls the AWS account. The _cluster service provider_ is the administrator who hosts cluster control planes and is responsible for uptime. In managed hosted control planes, the AWS account belongs to Red&nbsp;Hat.

In a prerequired and unmanaged infrastructure for the HyperShift Operator, the following infrastructure requirements apply for a management cluster AWS account:

* One S3 Bucket
** OpenID Connect (OIDC)
* Route 53 hosted zones
** A domain to host private and public entries for hosted clusters

[#infra-prerequired-unmanaged-hosted-cluster-aws]
=== Prerequired and unmanaged infrastructure in a hosted cluster AWS account

When your infrastructure is prerequired and unmanaged in a hosted cluster AWS account, the infrastructure requirements for all access modes are as follows:

* One VPC
* One DHCP Option
* Two subnets
** A private subnet that is an internal data plane subnet
** A public subnet that enables access to the internet from the data plane
* One internet gateway
* One elastic IP
* One NAT gateway
* One security group (worker nodes)
* Two route tables (one private and one public)
* Two Route 53 hosted zones
* Enough quota for the following items:
** One Ingress service load balancer for public hosted clusters
** One private link endpoint for private hosted clusters

*Note:* For private link networking to work, the endpoint zone in the hosted cluster AWS account must match the zone of the instance that is resolved by the service endpoint in the management cluster AWS account. In AWS, the zone names are aliases, such as `us-east-2b`, which do not necessarily map to the same zone in different accounts. As a result, for private link to work, the management cluster must have subnets or workers in all zones of its region.

[#infra-managed-by-hypershift-mgmt-aws-acct]
=== Hosted control planes-managed infrastructure in a management AWS account

When your infrastructure is managed by hosted control planes in a management AWS account, the infrastructure requirements differ depending on whether your clusters are public, private, or a combination.

For accounts with public clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* Network load balancer: a load balancer Kube API server
** Kubernetes creates a security group
* Volumes
** For etcd (one or three depending on high availability)
** For OVN-Kube

For accounts with private clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* Network load balancer: a load balancer private router
* Endpoint service (private link)

For accounts with public and private clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* Network load balancer: a load balancer public router
* Network load balancer: a load balancer private router
* Endpoint service (private link)
* Volumes:
** For etcd (one or three depending on high availability)
** For OVN-Kube

[#infra-managed-by-hypershift-in-hosted-cluster-aws-acct]
=== Hosted control planes-managed infrastructure in a hosted cluster AWS account

When your infrastructure is managed by hosted control planes in a hosted cluster AWS account, the infrastructure requirements differ depending on whether your clusters are public, private, or a combination.

For accounts with public clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* Node pools must have EC2 instances that have `Role` and `RolePolicy` defined.

For accounts with private clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* One private link endpoint for each availability zone
* EC2 instances for node pools

For accounts with public and private clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* One private link endpoint for each availability zone
* EC2 instances for node pools

[#infra-managed-by-kubernetes-in-hosted-cluster-aws-acct]
=== Kubernetes-managed infrastructure in a hosted cluster AWS account

When Kubernetes manages your infrastructure in a hosted cluster AWS account, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* A network load balancer for default Ingress
* An S3 bucket for registry

[#iam-aws]
== Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions

In the context of hosted control planes, the consumer is responsible to create the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) roles. The _consumer_ is an automated process to generate the permissions files. The consumer might be the command line interface or OpenShift Cluster Manager. Hosted control planes tries to enable granularity to honor the principle of least-privilege components, which means that every component uses its own role to operate or create AWS objects, and the roles are limited to what is required for the product to function normally.

For an example of how the command line interface can create the ARN roles, see "Creating AWS infrastructure and IAM resources separately".

The hosted cluster receives the ARN roles as input and the consumer creates an AWS permission configuration for each component. As a result, the component can authenticate through STS and preconfigured OIDC IDP.

The following roles are consumed by some of the components from hosted control planes that run on the control plane and operate on the data plane:

* `controlPlaneOperatorARN`
* `imageRegistryARN`
* `ingressARN`
* `kubeCloudControllerARN`
* `nodePoolManagementARN`
* `storageARN`
* `networkARN`

The following example shows a reference to the IAM roles from the hosted cluster:

[#hosting-cluster-aws-infra-iam-separate]
== Creating AWS infrastructure and IAM resources separately

By default, the `hcp create cluster aws` command creates cloud infrastructure with the hosted cluster and applies it. You can create the cloud infrastructure portion separately so that the `hcp create cluster aws` command can be used only to create the cluster, or render it so that you can modify it before you apply it. 

To create the cloud infrastructure portion separately, you need to create the AWS infrastructure, create the AWS Identity and Access (IAM) resources, and create the cluster.

[#hosting-cluster-create-aws-infra]
=== Creating the AWS infrastructure

To create the AWS infrastructure, use an infrastructure tool such as Terraform, Pulumi, or your own automation to create a YAML file that includes the following fields:

* One VPC
* One DHCP option
* One private subnet
* One public subnet
* One internet gateway
* One NAT gateway
* One security group for worker nodes
* Two route tables: 1 private and 1 public
* Two private hosted zones: 1 for cluster Ingress and 1 for PrivateLink, in case you create a private cluster

All of those resources contain the `kubernetes.io/cluster/<infra_id>=owned` tag, where `<infra_id>` is the value that you specified in the command.

[#hosting-cluster-create-aws-iam]
=== Creating the AWS IAM resources

In AWS, you need to create the following IAM resources:

* One OIDC provider, which is required to enable STS authentication
* Seven roles, which are separate for every component that interacts with the provider, such as the Kubernetes controller manager, cluster API provider, and registry
* One instance profile, which is the profile that is assigned to all worker instances of the cluster

. To create an OIDC provider, follow the steps in link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html[Create an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider in IAM] in the AWS documentation.

. To create the roles for each component that interacts with the provider, follow the procedures in link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create.html[Creating IAM roles] in the AWS documentation.

. To create an instance profile, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html[Using instance profiles] in the AWS documentation.

[#hosting-cluster-create-separate]
=== Creating the cluster

To create the cluster, enter the following command:

[source,bash]
[subs="+quotes"]
----
hcp create cluster aws \
    --infra-id <infra_id> \ <1>
    --name <cluster_name> \ <2>
    --aws-creds <aws_credentials> \ <3>
    --pull-secret <pull_secret_file> \ <4>
    --generate-ssh \ <5>
    --node-pool-replicas 3
----

<1> Replace `infra_id` with the same ID that you specified in the `create infra aws` command. This value identifies the IAM resources that are associated with the hosted cluster.
<2> Replace `cluster_name` with the same name that you specified in the `create infra aws` command.
<3> Replace `aws_credentials` with the same value that you specified in the `create infra aws` command.
<4> Replace `pull_secret_file` with the name of the file that contains a valid {ocp-short} pull secret.
<5> The `--generate-ssh` flag is optional, but is good to include in case you need to SSH to your workers. An SSH key is generated for you and is stored as a secret in the same namespace as the hosted cluster.

You can also add the `--render` flag to the command and redirect output to a file where you can edit the resources before you apply them to the cluster.

After you run the command, the following resources are applied to your cluster:

* A namespace
* A secret with your pull secret
* A `HostedCluster`
* A `NodePool`
* Three AWS STS secrets for control plane components
* One SSH key secret if you specified the `--generate-ssh` flag.
