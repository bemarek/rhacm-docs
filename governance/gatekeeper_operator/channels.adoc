= Operator channels

With the {gate}, you have access to two types of channels to help you make upgrades. These channels are the `stable` channel and the `y-stream version` channel.

With the `stable` channel, you can access the latest available version, including z-streams if relevant. For example, with the `stable` channel, you can access `v1.2.0`, `v1.2.1`, and also `v1.3.0`, if `v1.2.1` were released before `v1.3.0`. In this example, if another version `v1.2.2` were released after `v1.3.0`, it would not be included in the `stable` channel.

With the `y-stream version` channel, you can access all the z-streams for a particular y-stream. For example, the channel `1.2` could have `v1.2.0`, `v1.2.1`, `v1.2.2`, and more, but it would not include `v1.3.0`.
