= Gatekeeper operator overview 

Gatekeeper is a validating webhook with auditing capabilities. Install Gatekeeper on your {ocp} managed cluster by using the {gk-operator} policy that then installs Gatekeeper on your managed cluster by using the Red Hat {gk-operator} After you install Gatekeeper, use it for the following benefits: 

- Deploy and monitor Gatekeeper `ConstraintTemplates` and constraints on managed clusters by using the {product-title-short} policy integration. 
- Enforce Kubernetes custom resource definition-based policies that run with your Open Policy Agent (OPA).
- Evaluate Kubernetes resource compliance requests for the Kubernetes API by using the Gatekeeper constraints.
- Leverage OPA as the policy engine and use Rego as the policy language.

*Prerequisite:* You need a {acm} or {ocp} Plus subscription to install Gatekeeper and apply Gatekeeper policies to your cluster. Gatekeeper is supported only on {ocp-short} versions, except version 3.11, supported by the latest version of {acm-short}.
