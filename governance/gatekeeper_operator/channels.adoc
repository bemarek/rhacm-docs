= Operator channels

With the {gate}, you have access to two types of channels to help you make upgrades. These channels are the `stable` channel and the `y-stream version` channel.

With the `stable` channel, you can access the latest available version, including earlier z-streams if relevant. The `y-stream version` channels that are released after the latest version are not included the `stable` channel.

With the `y-stream version` channel, you can access all the z-streams for a particular y-stream. For example, the channel `1.2` could have `v1.2.0`, `v1.2.1`, `v1.2.2`, and more, but it would not include `v1.3.0`.
