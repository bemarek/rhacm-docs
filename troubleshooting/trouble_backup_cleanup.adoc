= Generic resources are removed when restoring a hub cluster backup

When you restore a hub cluster backup and use the `cleanupBeforeRestore: CleanupRestored` paramater on the `Restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource, the resources created by the `acm-resources-generic-schedule` backup might be removed.

[#symptom-backup-cleanup]
== Symptom: Generic resources are removed when restoring a hub cluster backup

Resources backed up in the `acm-resources-generic-schedule` backup do not appear on the restored hub cluster. If you check the backup operator log, you see a message that resembles the following:

----

[#resolving-backup-cleanup]
== Resolving the problem: Generic resources are removed when restoring a hub cluster backup

The resources are removed if the following conditions occur:

- You have resources backed up by the `acm-resources-generic-schedule` backup that do not match the Secret or ConfigMap resource type with a `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup` label.
- You run a restore that uses a `Restore.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` resource and you set the `cleanupBeforeRestore:` value to `CleanupRestored`.
- The latest {acm-short} backup set does not contain an `acm-resources-schedule` backup, so an older version of the backup is selected. As a result, the `acm-resources-schedule` backup has a different timestamp than the `acm-resources-generic-schedule` backup. During the post restore operation, when the CleanRestore option is processed, all generic resources are cleaned up because they do not have the same timestamp as the `acm-resources-schedule backup`.

To resolve the issue, run the restore operation again and set the `cleanupBeforeRestore:` value to `None`.`
