[#whats-new-{gk-tag}]
== What's new in {gk-operator} v{gk-version}

To learn the newest features of the Gatekeeper operator, see the following list: 

- Major upgrade from the previous {gk-operator} version, bringing the equivalent Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper version up to v3.11.
- Operator versioning alignment with the equivalent Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper for greater transparency.
- Gatekeeper is updated to the equivalent Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper version v3.14.
- The `Automatic` setting is added to the `auditFromCache` parameter. With this setting, the operator determines the constraints and populates the `spec.sync.syncOnly` field in the Gatekeeper `Config` object with the required resources for the constraints to function with the cache.
- The `operations` parameter is added to the webhook configuration in the operator, allowing configuration of API operations that the webhook responds to, allowing you to add the `DELETE` operation.
- Logging mutations, `logMutations`, and mutation annotations, `mutationAnnotations`, configurations are added to the operator configuration.
