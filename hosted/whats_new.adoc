= What's new in hosted control planes

* Starting with {ocp-short} 4.16, hosted control planes supports the user-provisioned installation and attachment of logical partition (LPAR) as compute nodes on IBM Z and IBM LinuxOne. To learn more, see xref:../../clusters/hosted_control_planes/add_agents_ibmz.adoc#hosted-bare-metal-adding-agents-ibmz-zvm[Adding IBM Z LPAR as agents].

* Configuring hosted control plane clusters on AWS is now generally available. You can deploy the HyperShift Operator on an existing managed cluster by using the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on to enable that cluster as a hosting cluster and start to create the hosted cluster. See xref:../../clusters/hosted_control_planes/aws_intro.adoc#hosting-service-cluster-configure-aws[Configuring hosted control plane clusters on AWS] for details.

* The `--sts-creds` and `--role-arn` flags replace the deprecated `--aws-creds` flag in the `hcp` command line interface. Create an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Identity and Access Management (IAM) role and Security Token Service (STS) credentials to use the `--sts-creds` and `--role-arn` flags. For more information, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/create_role_sts_aws.adoc#create-role-sts-aws[Creating an AWS IAM role and STS credentials].

//* When you create a cluster, you can map a single or multiple KubeVirt Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume snapshot classes to your hosted cluster. See xref:../../clusters/hosted_control_planes/config_storage_kubevirt.adoc#mapping-a-single-kubevirt-csi-volume-snapshot-class[Mapping a single KubeVirt CSI volume snapshot class] and xref:../../clusters/hosted_control_planes/config_storage_kubevirt.adoc#mapping-multiple-kubevirt-csi-volume-snapshot-classes[Mapping multiple KubeVirt CSI volume snapshot classes] for details.
